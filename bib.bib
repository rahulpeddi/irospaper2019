    abstract = { Autonomous helicopter flight is widely regarded to be a highly challenging control problem. Despite this fact, human experts can reliably fly helicopters through a wide range of maneuvers, including aerobatic maneuvers at the edge of the helicopter’s capabilities. We present apprenticeship learning algorithms, which leverage expert demonstrations to efficiently learn good controllers for tasks being demonstrated by an expert. These apprenticeship learning algorithms have enabled us to significantly extend the state of the art in autonomous helicopter aerobatics. Our experimental results include the first autonomous execution of a wide range of maneuvers, including but not limited to in-place flips, in-place rolls, loops and hurricanes, and even auto-rotation landings, chaos and tic-tocs, which only exceptional human pilots can perform. Our results also include complete airshows, which require autonomous transitions between many of these maneuvers. Our controllers perform as well as, and often even better than, our expert pilot. }

abstract = {For a set of geographical units in the Cartesian coordinate system, the locus of the standard deviation of the x coordinates of the set forms a closed curve as the system is rotated about the origin. This curve, often referred to as “standard deviational ellipse” (SDE), is not in fact an ellipse. The actual shape of the curve has remained unclear since the issue was mentioned initially by Lefever in 1926. In the present paper this closed curve, referred to as “standard deviation curve” (SDC), is clarified mathematically, and some of its applications in spatial analysis are discussed. The shape of SDC changes from a single circle to double circles when the distribution of the set of geographical units changes from an even condition to a straight line. The shape of SDC is determined explicitly by the ratio of its minor axis to its major axis. This ratio, therefore, is a useful index to show to what extent the distribution of a set of geographical units is circular, or linear. In addition, the size and radius of SDC can be used to indicate the distribution density of geographical units. The major axis of SDC, whose angle is determined explicitly for the first time, indicates the major orientation of geographical units. A program has been developed to apply SDC to spatial analysis (mean center, major orientation, distribution density, circular condition, etc.). The program is available from jx\_gong@hotmail.com. It is written in the MapBasic language, and runs under MapInfo.},
